<h2>1. Mental Health App (Rose Bud Thorn)</h2>

</br>

<h3>Original Proposal:</h3>

</br>

<p>
Getting access to mental health resources at Northeastern is really difficult. I would like to create a mobile application that allowed students to write down a rose, bud and thorn. Something good that happened to them, something bad that happened to them and something they are looking forward to. This application would connect them with other students that may have similar struggles and give them access to the appropriate resources like being able to schedule an appointment with University Health Services. 
</p>

</br>

<h3>Updated Proposal:</h3>

</br>

<p>
Mental health is a really important issue for everyone, but I think it is especially important to consider on a college campus. It is also frequently not talked about and under funded. From my personal experience, I have talked to several students who want more resources for their mental health and feel as though they don’t have easy access to them. 
</p>

</br>

<p>
I would like to create something simpler and more accessible for students to reflect on their mental health as well as be able to make connections with resources and other students. I want to create this application based off of an old Girl Scout’s tradition called “Rose Bud Thorn”. Whoever uses this app will have to write down something good that has happened to them, something bad that happened to them and something they are looking forward to.
