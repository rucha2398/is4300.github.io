<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I decided to pick Tatte because I wanted to observe students and how they go about multi tasking in terms of ordering food, finding places to sit and doing work. The target audience of the app that we would be creating would be students, and it is important to understand what kinds of tasks students do on a regular basis, especially related to their mobile phones. 
</p>

<p>
	Most of my biases have come from sitting in Tatte in the past and what I’ve observed then. I assumed that it would be pretty crowded with few to no open tables. I also assumed that most people would be doing work because it was a Sunday afternoon. The noise levels in Tatte generally vary, but I thought it might be on the louder side because a lot of people do group work in there.
</p>

<p>
	For an overview of the situation, I decided to go to Tatte on a pretty warm sunny day, specifically January 26th, 2020. I sat at the counter so that I could have a view of people ordering coffee, picking it up, adding sugar/cream/etc, and then trying to find a seat. I sat here for an hour and a half observing various people as well as the interactions they had with their environment and other people. 
</p>

<p>
	The three main types of people that I observed were the Tatte staff, students and tourists. There were many interactions between the staff and customers, but not a lot between customers and other groups of customers. The customers themselves were divided into a couple of groups. Some came alone to pick something up for takeout. They generally wore headphones and were on their phones. Another type of customer was someone who came with their friends to find a spot to do work. They would generally wait in the waiting area and talk or scout to find an empty table. 
</p>

<p>
	An interesting thing I observed was that for all the people who came in alone listening to music to pick up a coffee, they would take out one headphone every time the barista called a name. Once in a while, someone would not hear their name, and ask the barista if their name had already been called or not. 
</p>

<p>
	The biggest problem I observed in Tatte centered around the physical space. The cafe is pretty small and crowded. The walkways between points are very narrow and cause disruption. The place where you wait for your coffee is right in front of the door to Marino. There were a couple of times when someone waiting had to move because people were trying to get in and out of Marino. In that same area, people were picking up their coffee, people were trying to find a place to sit, the waiters trying to serve food and people trying to add sugar and milk to their coffee. The fact that there were so many things happening at once led to a couple of mishaps. Once, one of the waiters spilled some food because she ran into another person picking up their coffee. The spill was cleaned up quickly. Another time, someone carrying their coffee in the cup and saucer spilled a little bit on the ground because they ran into someone who was trying to add cream and sugar to their drinks. 
</p>

<p>
	The interviews I had were pretty insightful. I interviewed one individual who bought coffee to take out and another group of individuals who was sitting at Tatte to enjoy a snack during their study break. It was interesting because a lot of my biases and observations from the past hour turned out to be true. From both interviews, I determined that there is a pretty distinct purpose people go to Tatte for, and that really determines how they experience the space. For the person who was going to pick up a coffee, they found it a difficult space to navigate through because of its limited ability to get in and out. For someone who was sitting there for a while, and just trying to enjoy food, they had fewer complaints. Overall, it seems like it is a difficult place to do work that involves a lot of concentration because of the amount of distractions.

<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p>
	The biggest takeaway I had from this ethnographic study was that space is really important to an individual. The way that a space is organized can create positive or negative experiences very quickly. The way the space is organized can affect how people use the products in that space and why they keep coming back to use it. I think this information can be used when designing a digital interface. Just like in real life, users have a very quick understanding of what a space, whether it is digital or physical, means to them. Depending on the nature of the product, the space needs to be designed in a way that is conducive to the purpose of the product. In terms of the diary style app we are designing, I might imagine this as more open space so that there is “breathability” in the app. This might make someone feel more comfortable writing down personal thoughts.
