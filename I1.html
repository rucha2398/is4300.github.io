<h1>I1: Individual Assignment #1: Brainstorming</h1>


<h2>1. Swipe2Care</h2>

<p>
At Northeastern, the dining hall swipe system still works using a physical card. This application would be a mobile application that would be scanned upon entering the dining hall. Northeastern has a system called Swipe2Care where you can donate unused meal swipes to someone who is food insecure. The app would have a workflow that allowed easy ability to donate unused meal swipes to this program. Along with this, the user would be able to easily see what food is offered at each dining hall and hours of operation.

<h2>2. Mental Health App (Rose Bud Thorn)</h2>
<p>
Getting access to mental health resources at Northeastern is really difficult. I would like to create a mobile application that allowed students to write down a rose, bud and thorn. Something good that happened to them, something bad that happened to them and something they are looking forward to. This application would connect them with other students that may have similar struggles and give them access to the appropriate resources like being able to schedule an appointment with University Health Services.

<h2>3. Textbook Marketplace </h2>
<p>
When I was searching for the textbook for this class, I realized that there isn’t a very efficient way of figuring out whether people at Northeastern have textbooks they might want to give to other people. Textbooks are really expensive, and I think there should be a way for people to sell/rent their old textbooks. It could be a web app or mobile app that allowed people to take pictures of their textbooks and give them to other people. Graduated students could also use this application.

<h2>4. NEUGo</h2>
<p>
Multiplayer game for new students to help them get acquainted with the campus. Similar to Pokemon Go, students would have to go around campus finding popular areas and answering questions at each of the stops. This would make it an activity that someone could do alone or with friends. 
</p>

</br>


<h2>5. Skills Marketplace</h2>
<p>
There are lots of clubs and organizations at Northeastern that need people to help run their clubs and organizations. Many post on Facebook and other social media to find people to help them. This would be a marketplace for Northeastern students to post “jobs” for other students that are not necessarily paid, but a consolidated list of all the clubs and organizations that someone could join. People could filter by interest, time commitment, etc.
</p>

<h2>6. Co-op Connections</h2>
<p>
A Linkedin sort of application where people can post their experiences at companies they have co-oped at so that younger students can read those experiences while on their own co-op searches. A networking tool to build the co-op community at Northeastern.
